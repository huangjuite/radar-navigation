# Enabling  Learning-based  Navigation  in  Obscurants  with  Cross-modalRepresentations  for  Lightweight,  Low-cost  mmWave  Radar  usingGenerative  Reconstruction  and  Contrastive  Learning

## Intro
This repo demonstrate using generative model to reconstruct mmWave radar range data to dense range data closer to LiDAR ground truth.

The reconstructed range data can be used as signals for control policys.
